A standalone implementation of hash table in JavaScript. It associates keys with values, and allows any object to be used as the key (unlike JavaScript's built-in `Object`, which only allows strings as property names).
Also included is a hash set implementation, implemented by wrapping the keys of a hash table.

jshashtable requires no libraries and is designed to work in all ECMAScript 3 compliant environments, including all major browsers and Node.js. In particular, it has been tested and works in:

- Firefox (all versions, back to Phoenix 0.1)
- Internet Explorer 5.5+
- Safari 3+ (untested in previous versions)
- Google Chrome (all versions)
- Opera 7+
