Professor Alan Labouseur

Project One
'Begin	your	compiler	by	writing	a	lexer	that	validates	source	code	against	
the	grammar	found	on	our	class	web	site	at	http://www.labouseur.com/
courses/compilers/grammar.pdf.'

Project Two
'1. Project	one	working	perfectly.	
2. Write	a	recursive	descent	parser	and	add	it	to	your	compiler.	The	parser	
must	validate	the	tokens	you	lexed	from	project	one.
3. While	parsing,	create	a	concrete	syntax	tree	(CST).	If	parsing	is	
successful	(i.e.,	no	errors	were	found)	then	display	the	CST.	Make	it	neat,	
if	not	also	pretty'

Project Three
'1. Projects	one	and	two	working	perfectly.	
2. Create	an	AST	from	the	tokens	or	from	the	CST.	Display	it.	
3. Write	a	semantic	analyzer	that	scope-checks	and	type-checks	the	AST	
based	on	the	grammar	found	on	our	class	web	site	at	http://
www.labouseur.com/courses/compilers/grammar.pdf	and	the	type	
rules	we	discussed	in	class.'

Project Four
'1. Projects	one,	two,	and	three	working	perfectly.	
2. Write	a	code	generator	that	takes	your	AST	and	generates	6502a	
machine	code	(found	at	http://www.labouseur.com/courses/compilers/
6502a-instruction-set.pdf)	for	our	language	grammar	found	on	our	class	
web	site	at	http://www.labouseur.com/courses/compilers/
grammar.pdf.'

Will be using javascript (most likely).

How To Run:

1.Download repo

2.Extract repo to folder on PC

3.Run the index.html file on a browser with Javascript enabled

4.Once loaded in a browser, there should be a lexer input box with line numbers and a lexer output box

5.Write a program in the lexer input, or load up a test program, and then click the lex button

6.Output should appear on the bottom with results
